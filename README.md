# DomainDog - Reverse Whois lookups from the CLI
---

For passive asset discovery, discovering domain names can be a valuable intelligence source. With the decline of Whois usage, reverse whois still lives on and can still be queried. DomainDog scrapes viewinfo so you can do lookups from your commandline - perfect for piping into [aquatone](https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone) for bug bounties or wide-scope blackbox penetration tests.

# Usage

```
./dog.rb -s "query@domain.com"
```

Easy as that!
